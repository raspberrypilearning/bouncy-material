In the Project window select 'Materials' and then 'PhysicsMaterials'. Right-click in the window, click 'Create' and select **Physic Material**. 

Give your physics material a sensible name, like `Bounce`. 

Adjust the **Bounce** value in the 'Inspector' window based on the bounciness effect that you want to add. You can use a value from 0-1. 0 will not bounce. 1 will keep bouncing without losing energy.

Drag the new bouncy physics material onto the GameObject that you would like to have a bounciness effect.
